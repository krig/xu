`xub` is a HTML5-based web ui for XMMS2. Start it, then go to
`http://localhost:5000` with your browser of choice (your browser
of choice is Chrome, preferrably).

## Installing

There's no installer yet, just make sure the `xu` and `xub` binaries
are in your `PATH`.

## Dependencies

* [urwid][urwid]
* [PIL][PIL]
* [flask][flask]
* [xmmsclient][xmmsclient]

  [xmmsclient]: https://xmms2.org/

## Using xu

Just run `xu` to launch the interface. `xu` will try to start the
XMMS2 server if it's not running. It uses the `XMMS_PATH` environment
variable to locate the server, so set that if you're running the
server on a different computer.

To add music to the playlist, hit `:` to enter the command mode. Once
in command mode, you can add with the same type of commands that the
`xmms2` command line interface uses.

For example, to add all albums by Loklok the cat, use

    :add artist~loklok

There is a shortcut to this command, since I use it all the time:

    :+ loklok

Some other useful commands:

    :clear
    :playlist create <name>
    :playlist switch <name>
    :server rehash

Some of these commands have vim-style single letter shortcuts:

    :a(dd)
    :j(ump)
    :n(ext)
    :p(rev)
    :t(oggle)
    :s(top)
    :r(emove)
    :c(lear)
    (p):l(aylist)
    :q(uit)

Hit `p` to pause, `enter` to start playing the currently selected
playlist entry, `q` to exit `xu` (playback will continue
uninterrupted).
